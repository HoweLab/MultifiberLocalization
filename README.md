# MultifiberLocalization
MATLAB code to register CT scans to the Allen Mouse Brain CCF Atlas, and to localize multifiber photometry fibers. This code was written and developed in MATLAB2020b. See [Vu et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627323009704?via%3Dihub). The code used in the original publication has been improved and adpated for public use here. Contact maianhvu@bu.edu with any questions.

# MAIN STEPS
Each of these steps is packaged in a MATLAB App. There are 2 ways to run each of these apps.
1. The .mlappinstall file contains the installer for the standalone app and includes the dependencies required.
2. If you have the dependencies required in your path (see below), you can alternatively just run the .mlapp file.


## 1) GENERATE_ATLAS_FILES 
This only needs to be run once to generate the atlas files necessary. Be sure you have atlas files (see above) downloaded first. You will end up with the following files in this repository folder (note that the double dots .. means one folder above this one):
  * **specified_atlas_location_path/MRIAtlas/CCF/average_template_10_coronal.tif** -- the atlas
  * **specified_atlas_location_path/MRIAtlas/CCF/annotation_10_coronal.tif** -- the annotated/labeled atlas
  * **specified_atlas_location_path/MRIAtlas/CCF/ccf_key.mat** -- key containing the annotation labels and other information
  * **specified_atlas_location_path/MRIAtlas/CCF/landmarks.points** -- the reference landmarks for registration
  * **specified_atlas_location_path/MRIAtlas/Chon/Chon_CCF_coronal.tif** -- the atlas
  * **specified_atlas_location_path/MRIAtlas/Chon/Chon_labels_coronal.tif** -- the annotated/labeled atlas
  * **specified_atlas_location_path/MRIAtlas/Chon/chon_key.mat** -- key containing the annotation labels and other information

## 2) REGISTER_CT
Register a 3D CT image to the atlas. See REGISTER_CT_README.pdf for instructions and more info.

## 3) LOCALIZE_FIBERS
Localize the fibers in a registered CT image. See LOCALIZE_FIBERS_README.pdf for instructions and more info.

## Other useful functions included:
1. **atlas_labels.m**
   * This function takes as input a m x 3 matrix of coordinates (mm from bregma) or indices (in atlas matrix space) in the order AP-ML-DV, where each row is a different point. It returns the anatomical labels assigned to the point by the Allen Mouse Brain CCF Atlas and the Kim Lab Atlas. Open the function or type 'help atlas_labels' for more info.
   * example: output = atlas_labels('coord', [0.8, 2.3, -3.4; 0.5, 2, -2]);
   * example: output = atlas_labels('idx', [445 800 413; 475 770 254]);
